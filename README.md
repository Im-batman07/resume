A developer who loves both design and logic.
I enjoy building interfaces that are simple on the outside but powered by clear, reliable code inside.

I’m Ankit Padhiyar, a web developer who combines front-end skills with a strong foundation in C and Python. I like taking ideas from a blank screen to a complete experience — whether it’s a small utility, a learning project, or a full portfolio.

My work often starts with a sketch of the interface, then I build the structure in HTML, bring it to life with CSS, and make it interactive using JavaScript. I also use C and Python to sharpen my algorithmic thinking and solve more complex problems.

Some things that describe the way I work:

Focus on readability and well-structured code.
Responsive layouts that work on desktop and mobile.
Curious about performance, accessibility and best practices.
Always learning through new mini-projects and experiments.
